# Omarchy Supplement Scripts

Scripts to setup a fresh Omarchy installation with config and programs etc.

## Usage

Make the main install script executable.
```sh
chmod +x install.sh
```

Run the install script.
```sh
./install.sh
```

## TODO

- [ ] Optional reinstall all dotfiles so the entire config isn't deleted (mainly for Neovim)
- [ ] Restart walker without it listening to the next time it opens
